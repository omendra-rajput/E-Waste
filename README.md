# E-Waste Management System Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest-growing waste streams globally. With the rapid evolution of technology and the increasing consumption of electronic devices, effective e-waste management has become critical for environmental sustainability. 

This project presents a **Machine Learning-powered E-Waste Management System** that classifies different types of e-waste, processes large-scale data, and visualizes waste trends to help environmental organizations, recyclers, and policymakers make informed decisions.

## Objectives

- Develop a supervised machine learning model to accurately classify e-waste into defined categories.
- Process large volumes of e-waste data using Apache Spark for scalability.
- Generate meaningful visual reports using Tableau to support environmental organizations in strategy formulation.
- Build an end-to-end pipeline from raw data ingestion to visualization.

## Key Features

### 1. Machine Learning-Based E-Waste Classification
A classification model trained using TensorFlow and Keras identifies and categorizes e-waste into 10 specific categories (e.g., batteries, cables, laptops, circuit boards).

### 2. Big Data Processing with Apache Spark
Efficiently processes over **50,000+ e-waste records** using Sparkâ€™s distributed computing framework, enabling real-time and batch processing.

### 3. Data Visualization Using Tableau
Sector-wise and category-wise reports are created in Tableau for better understanding of waste distribution. These reports are interactive, exportable, and used by 20+ environmental stakeholders.

### 4. High Accuracy
Achieved **92% classification accuracy** using cleaned data and hyperparameter tuning, ensuring reliable categorization.
